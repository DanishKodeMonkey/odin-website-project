# Odin website project

A training website to bring together what I've learned so far from the odin projects curriculum!

An exciting practise to see what stuck and what didn't from the material, and put it into practise.

## The goal

The goal is to reach a website design as close to the design of this, created by the Odin Project. All on my own:

## Where is this coming from?

If what I'm doing seems interested, consider checking out the open source full stack curriculum called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It's really cool!
